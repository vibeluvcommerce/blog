<p>How to use: Add both ingredients into one cup, soak in boiling water for 5 minutes and drink. This is a famous Chinese medicine recipe for men. This recipe must use sea ginseng, ordinary ginseng does not have this effect. The Chinese wolfberries are large, full and uniform in color.</p>
<p>Eight tips to make love more sexual happiness</p>
<p>1, eliminate the time difference of 12~36 minutes.</p>
<p>Men on average need about 6~8 minutes to reach sexual satisfaction, women usually need 20~40 minutes, there is a time difference of about 12~36 minutes between the two. The partner should be aware of this time difference and shorten it by more physical caresses.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Carry out foreplay outside the bedroom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Foreplay must not be optional, but a &quot;requirement&quot;. It is not limited to the physical aspects of sexual contact, in addition to some explicit sexual expression, send erotic text messages, say compliments and mutual massage can better stimulate the partner's desire.</p>
<p>3, fast meet before stopping.</p>
<p>Between partners can be used &quot;to escape&quot; method to extend the time of intercourse, that is, almost reached sexual satisfaction when the abrupt end, start again. It should be remembered that the slightly flawed intercourse can not be transformed overnight, both sides must persistently adhere to the exercise and practice, in order to learn to stay on the bed for a longer period of time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Always use lubricant.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every couple can benefit from using lubricant: it helps with lubrication, reduces pain, and increases eroticism. ...... Lubricant should be a standard, kept handy.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Keeping in a good mood helps fulfillment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Surveys have shown that it is easier to achieve fulfillment is those who are young, have a harmonious relationship in their marriage overall, and are in a relaxed and happy mood. When the mind is good, happy life, couples can achieve double satisfaction of body and mind during intercourse --- this is the supreme state of intercourse, not only what women seek, men are also the same. To get such satisfaction, maintain a happy mood, create a comfortable room environment, exchange room feeling are very important.</p>
<p>6, don't exclude erotic toys.</p>
<p>For some couples, it is true that the initial use of sex toys is a bit awkward and strange, but this is just a process of sexual improvement. If you are not accustomed to vibrators and other toys, you can choose to have floating condoms to increase the fun.</p>
<p>7, Don't stay away from masturbation.</p>
<p>Although it's harder for women to achieve fulfillment, exploring your body will make a difference. Masturbation is a shortcut to fulfillment. The survey found that half of the women through masturbation to achieve sexual satisfaction for the first time in their lives, couples mutual masturbation is also a good way.</p>
<p>8, multiple satisfaction is not difficult.</p>
<p>Women should not period (refers to the end of an intercourse to the body state and can start the next intercourse between the necessary interval time) is shorter than men, so you can experience multiple satisfaction. Therefore, men can first satisfy women through caressing, etc., and then reach the peak together.</p>
