                <p>What should couples do if they have a low quality sex life? It has been found that before the start of a couple's sex life, some room games help to improve the quality of sex life, and keep sex life fresh. This is undoubtedly a good catalyst for the couple's relationship. Here are a few kinds of room games for you to take a look.</p>
<p>First, baby games</p>
<p>Couples can pretend to be children, very &quot;curious&quot; to see each other's bodies and breasts. Can also be like a baby like murmuring, stimulate each other's mother love or father love. Husbands can act like sons, lying in their wives' arms, &quot;acting out, being bad and wild&quot;, tweaking and sucking on their wives' nipples. For the childless wife, her husband's suckling melts her desire for a future child into tenderness for him. For wives who have children, the gentle touch of her husband's lips evokes in her mind all the happy memories of feeding her children in the past.</p>
<p>Second, animal games</p>
<p>Couples imitate animal play, play, sexual intercourse action, take turns acting to each other to see, thereby causing each other's laughter, relaxation due to other things and taut nerves, to maintain a relaxed, happy and humorous state of mind. 1973 Changsha Mawangdui No. 3 Han Tomb unearthed the &quot;together yin and yang&quot; book, discusses the ten kinds of imitation of animal play sexual intercourse action, and called the &quot;ten sections and called it &quot;Ten Sections&quot;. These ten sections are the specific application of ancient bionics in the room life. It argues that these ten actions can be used both to playfully tease, but also to imitate its posture * intercourse.</p>
<p>Third, naked and fantasy games</p>
<p>Couples naked all over, either in the accompaniment of soft romantic music, dancing sexy dance. Either embracing each other and lying down talking about love, touching each other's bodies. Either have a game of chess, lose a game to take off a piece of clothing. Can also be in the soft light, prepare some food and wine, while eating and drinking and chatting, chatting when don't let the eyes idle. When needed, ruffle the ends of her hair for her, help him wipe away the remaining crumbs of food on his lips. Maybe it's just a night of pure talk, or maybe it's a night of lingering.</p>
<p>Four, sex game notes</p>
<p>Couples doing sex games, pay attention to one thing: do not do before and in the middle of thinking about it to lead to sexual intercourse activities. Because once this kind of psychology, do up will be distracted, want to end as soon as possible sex games, so that the other party has a kind of feeling of being used. Sex games can be * intercourse &quot;prelude&quot;, can also be a sexual activity &quot;solo&quot;. Both partners should focus on the emotional experience of pleasure and intimacy rather than on whether it will lead to intercourse. When one party has no desire to have sex, the other party should take it as a unique sexual experience, can not force each other; when both sides of the emotional high, sexual intercourse will be water to the end. In short, everything should go with the flow, only to emphasize the process rather than the end.</p>
