                <p>What are some romantic kissing techniques? When it comes to couples, many of them start with kissing, and kissing is indeed an effective form of foreplay. So what are the romantic kissing techniques? The following small series will be introduced to you.</p>
<p>Kissing is an important means of regulating the life of a couple. What kind of kissing can increase the atmosphere? Quickly follow the small series to find out.</p>
<p>First, seven romantic ways of kissing</p>
<p>Blowing kissing. That is, when your lips touch, gently blow your breath into each other's mouth. This is a highly skilled way of kissing that can enhance the intimacy between two people. However, it is best not to use this method after drinking or smoking, so as not to transfer the odor to the other person and make him feel disgusted. In addition, do not blindly blow so that the other person can not breathe, otherwise it will also spoil the wonderful feeling of kissing.</p>
<p>Spiral kissing. Stick your tongue into each other's mouth and keep rotating it. This method should only be used when the two people are in silent cooperation.</p>
<p>Deep Kissing. Stick your tongue deep into each other's mouths, even to the depths of the throat. This method is not suitable for people with too long a tongue, as it will come into contact with the other person's throat and may be inappropriately disgusting.</p>
<p>Sucking on the lips. Hold or suck on the other person's lips. Because the mucous membranes of a woman's lips are more fragile, men must be gentle when sucking and stop immediately when they see pain in the other person's expression.</p>
<p>Kissing the teeth. Gently lick the other person's teeth with the tip of your tongue. It's best not to consider each tooth or it will feel like a dental checkup.</p>
<p>Vacuum kissing. After the lips touch, try to absorb as much air as possible from the other person's mouth. This method of kissing must take into account the shape of the man's and woman's lips. If one lip is too big and the other too small, like a small dandelion covering a large sunflower, it doesn't achieve the effect of a vacuum, but it also makes one person feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>French Kissing. The supreme technique of kissing is illegal kissing. Sex experts can't miss this move. When kissing, you should add more techniques to your tongue, such as gently probing into the other person's mouth with your tongue first, then gently licking the inside of her mouth to get the other person's tongue entangled.</p>
<p>Second, different kisses have different meanings</p>
<p>Although all seven of these kissing styles are mesmerizing, they have different meanings.</p>
<p>For example, French kissing and deep kissing represent endless exploration and deeper contact, so they fully unleash each other's passion and are best suited as an important part of foreplay. Blow kissing is a bit naughty and mischievous and is perfect for two people to try out while having fun. Kissing on the teeth is an option for the most intimate of lovers.</p>
<p>There are little taboos for everyone in the kissing process, and only a good kisser can win the heart of a lover.</p>
<p>First of all, it is necessary to respond. Some women will just stand when kissing, with their hands stiff and drooping. Their boyfriends are like kissing a piece of wood. Imagine how he would feel inside. Therefore, once you accept a kiss from the other person, you have to respond.</p>
<p>Secondly, fight a prepared battle. Some men always like to attack each other unexpectedly and are used to kissing so roughly that the woman becomes a helpless lamb. The occasional accident may be refreshing for women, but more often than not it makes them wonder: do men respect the need to kiss?</p>
<p>Finally, mutual respect. Both men and women must prepare themselves before kissing. If time permits, you can brush your teeth, rinse your mouth or chew gum. A fresh tone of voice is the first step to a successful kiss, it also gives a hint to the other person: I take our kiss very seriously.</p>
<p>Taboos of kissing for men and women</p>
<ol>
<li>Bad breath</li>
</ol>
<p>There is nothing worse for couples who have just fallen in love. If you have such a problem, check your stomach and mouth problems and, of course, the most urgent and effective method is mints. If you don't want to say SayGoodbye to each other, please keep your breath fresh oh!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Tongue kiss is too passionate</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe your love for him (or his love for you) is difficult to hold yourself, too enthusiastic and active, but will scare each other step by step, remember to rush! Suggested reference to romantic French kissing.</p>
<p>3, too reserved</p>
<p>It's always good to keep some mystery, but it doesn't always fully apply to relationships. If you really like each other, please let each other feel your passionate response in the right atmosphere!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Too stiff</li>
</ol>
<p>The stupidest way to kiss is to just lift your lips and stand there stiff and aloof. How can he kiss you? It's awkward, but some girls are like that! Kissing is a time when two people can't help themselves when they're in love, so how can you be such a dull spoilsport?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>No hands</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you ever noticed where two people put their hands when they kiss? Is it warm when your beloved caresses your face or gently stops your waist while kissing? If you really like each other, extend your hand at the right time.</p>
