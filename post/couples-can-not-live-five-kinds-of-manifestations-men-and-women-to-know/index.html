                <p>Between husband and wife, if you can't go on, then there are five manifestations, that is quite obvious, between the two people, as long as the five situations, go on without any meaning; see husband and wife can't go on five manifestations.</p>
<p>Married life, every couple, in just married, are thinking to be with each other, with each other for life, and keep each other for life; but the marriage road, not always smooth sailing, there are a lot of times, will always be because of some things, between the two, there is a contradiction, produced a rift; and there are some cases, and will not make the husband and wife, the feelings of all the rupture; however, there are some cases, it will certainly make the Between two people, can not go on; two people can not go on, some have some very obvious performance; so couples can not go on five kinds of performance is which?</p>
<p>First, not only every day noise, and also moved the hand</p>
<p>In the married life, between husband and wife, because from childhood to adulthood, two people grow up in different environments, the idea is not the same, so in the treatment of a matter of opinion will not be the same, will not be unanimous; this is in fact very normal, but to understand each other, mutual tolerance; if the couple together, not only every day noisy, and also will be hands to hit, play the rough behavior, then such a husband and wife, it is impossible to go how much! Far; because the woman's heart, the bottom of the sea needle, there is no that a woman, can accept to be their loved ones, scolding every day; because now a lot of women, from childhood are pampered by their parents grew up, and how to accept, their own men's merciless treatment.</p>
<p>Second, long-term separation, there is no normal conjugal life</p>
<p>Husband and wife together for a lifetime, maintaining the bond of affection, that is, couples must live a normal married life; people are flesh and blood people, need to get energy release; if two people living apart for a long time, do not get energy release; natural heart, it will be particularly uncomfortable, it will be very unhappy; there are a lot of times, will also be suffocated to disease; so such a situation, the husband and wife days to the other side, it is not possible to go! How far; in the couple's life, if the two people can not get physical satisfaction, one day, the two people will go their own way, become strangers; this is the husband and wife life on the road, the most helpless thing.</p>
<p>Third, never communicate, endless cold war</p>
<p>In married life, there are many things between husband and wife, that is the need to communicate, to be able to get a solution; if two people together, there are a lot of things that can not be satisfactorily dealt with, then naturally can not be solved; between the two people, always endless cold war, then the two people live in the world, that is a particularly helpless thing; if two people together, have reached the step of the If two people together, have reached the step of no words, then with a stranger there is no difference; in this case, divorce is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Fourth, one of the people outside the marriage really love someone else</p>
<p>True love is deep-rooted, is unable to self-control; a person's heart, as long as truly in love with a person, then the other party is all everything, is all, is the world; a person's heart, with the existence of another person, then no matter for each other, how much to pay, are all willing things; between husband and wife, if one of them, outside of marriage, really in love with a person, then such a Marriage, it must not go far; because the true love of the people, will be for the people outside the marriage, pay for all of their own everything, hand over their own a true heart; at this time, the dumping of the family, that is a very normal thing; the two go their own way, that is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Fifth, the other side of things, show hand bystanders</p>
<p>Couples live together, that is a whole; two people's things, that are a family of things; but if couples live together, the man's things, is the man's things, the woman's things, is the woman's things, then such couples, live together, will not last long; because of their own beloved, are show hand bystanders, then in the future of life, and what kind of a Meaning; two people have divided each other, treat each other as strangers; then such a couple life, there is no meaning.</p>
<p>Husband and wife can not go on five performance is the most typical, but there are also many cases, between husband and wife, can not go on; but no matter how, since there is a chance to become a husband and wife, should be caring for each other, mutual understanding; have a chance to be together, have to cherish; management of the marriage, that is the need to pay attention to the method; but can not tolerate, but is the most critical point; want to live a lifetime of happy life, then you have to be Endure each other; good day is run out, and bad day is also their own hands destroyed; so all couples, should be to walk and cherish.</p>
