                <p>Usually women aged 40 to 54 face menopause, this stage of the decline in ovarian function, physical, mental and neurological and other aspects of the changes that occur, specifically for irregular menstruation, mood swings, hot flashes and night sweats, urinary tract infections, weight gain, sleep disorders, and at the same time the decline in sexual desire, to the point of sexual frigidity. However, this does not mean a complete rejection of sexual life, appropriate changes can also be made from which to obtain pleasure.</p>
<p>How to improve the quality of sex life during menopause?</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand your own physical and mental changes</li>
</ol>
<p>Women in menopause should understand their own physical and mental changes, such as temper tantrums, difficulty in controlling emotions, vaginal dryness and atrophy. Understand their own emotional triggers, their own needs, patiently tell their other half, teach them how to mobilize their emotions. Generally, women's menopause is 5 to 10 years earlier than men's, so most men can't understand how menopause will change; due to women's changes and break the original balance of life, men also need enough time to adapt to, during which couples should have enough patience, appropriate guidance.</p>
<p>2„ÄÅMore communication</p>
<p>Due to a series of changes caused by menopause, women have a strong sense of frustration, such as difficulty in controlling emotions, anger, anxiety and depression always occur for no reason; or feel unable to control the body; or sexual pleasure is reduced, even if there is a sexual desire, but because of the vaginal dryness, vaginal wall weakness, elasticity decline, and the occurrence of pain or discomfort during intercourse, or even produce a sense of sexual aversion, due to the changes occurring in the woman and the other party. affects the other party. Couples at this stage should communicate more to understand how the changes affect the other party and hope to get the other party's understanding.</p>
<p>3„ÄÅCooperation</p>
<p>At the age of 40-54, both men and women will feel the big changes in their lives, such as not being satisfied with their work, or putting more energy and strength into their work; their children have become independent and need to go out to study or work; their marriages are lacking in freshness, and the couple's relationship is getting more and more tense. In short, this stage faces numerous problems and is prone to anxiety and depression, while carrying greater pressure, which in turn makes sexual desire decline. Couples at this stage should work together to understand and support each other in dealing with depression and anxiety. As long as both men and women can feel the full love and warmth, then it is easy to reach a consensus on sexual life, but also to reduce many aspects of the conflict.</p>
<p>Warm tips</p>
<p>Although menopause will make the body and life changes, but does not necessarily affect the sexual desire. As a woman, you should learn to understand and accept your own changes, and both husband and wife together to seek a new mode of life, appropriate changes in the way of sex, so as to enhance sexual satisfaction.</p>
