                <p>There are many reasons for pain down there when having sex, the common ones are too much force or improper posture in coitus, vaginitis, endometriosis, etc. It can also be caused when a man suffers from prepuce glans dermatitis, prostatitis, epididymitis.</p>
<p>Excessive force or improper posture during coitus</p>
<p>If the preparation of foreplay is insufficient, the female vagina lacks expansion and lubrication, at this time, if the male partner is too hard or improper posture, frictional pain is likely to occur, and even lead to their own foreskin laceration, for women can lead to damage to the vaginal opening or mucous membranes, the vaginal opening can have a burning pain sensation. Especially when women have intercourse for the first time, if the posture and force are not appropriate, it can lead to vaginal soft tissue damage or hymen damage.</p>
<p>Vaginitis</p>
<p>If you suffer from trichomonas vaginitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis or atrophic vaginitis, the vaginal mucosa due to inflammation stimulation appears congested or even erosion, at this time, coitus will be below the pain, but also accompanied by vulvar itching, leukorrhea and other uncomfortable symptoms.</p>
<p>Endometriosis</p>
<p>If you suffer from endometriosis, when intercourse involves ectopic lesions or local adhesions, you may experience deep pain during intercourse, and the degree of pain is directly proportional to the number of times you have intercourse and the magnitude of your intercourse movements.</p>
<p>Other reproductive system diseases</p>
<p>For male patients, if there is foreskin glans, prostatitis, epididymitis, orchitis, penile cavernous sclerosis and other reproductive system diseases, the stimulation of the affected area during coitus can also appear as a symptom of pain in the lower body during coitus. Women with vaginal spasms, congenital vaginal deformities and other diseases may also experience pain at the vaginal opening during intercourse.</p>
<p>Other factors</p>
<p>In addition, when women enter menopause or menopause, due to the decrease in the secretion of relevant sex hormones, the vagina can be physiologically atrophic and dry, which will lead to male penile insertion and twitching obstacles, and is also prone to female sexual intercourse pain.</p>
<p>In short, if you are not sure what is going on when you have sex, it is best to go to a regular hospital in time to find out the cause of the disease and then treat the symptoms, so as to ensure that the &quot;sexual well-being&quot;.</p>
