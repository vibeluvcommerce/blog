                <p>For many young boys and girls in their prime, a lack of knowledge about the sexes can result in lifelong regrets.<br>
Many children ask at an early age: Where did I come from? Most parents will not tell their children that they are the result of sex between mom and dad, the sperm and egg combine to fertilize the egg and develop slowly; they will not tell their children what condoms are and what they do; they will not tell their sons not to have sex if they cannot be responsible for her and really love her...<br>
They will only tell their children to protect themselves when they have a boyfriend, but how? Parents avoid talking about it.</p>
<p>Husband and wife life is not something unseemly, the fear is that you meet someone and hurt yourself, so women need to do the following things when they have sex with their partner for the first time:<br>
Good living habits: reasonable diet, good living habits, no alcohol and no smoking, stay away from drugs.</p>
<p>sexual organ hygiene: women are more susceptible to infection than boys, wash before each couple's life to prevent infectious diseases of the female genitourinary system, and wash afterwards.<br>
Reasonable arrangement of time, frequency and timing of conjugal life according to the specific conditions of both husband and wife; women should pay attention to the hygiene of conjugal life during menstruation, pregnancy, breastfeeding and menopause; those with heart, lung, liver, kidney and other important organs not functioning properly or those who are suffering from hypertension, arteriosclerosis and other serious illnesses should be guided by a physician to have conjugal life.<br>
Contraception: Couples of childbearing age who no longer wish to have children or who do not wish to have children for the time being should adopt effective contraceptive measures suitable for both couples to avoid unwanted pregnancies. (Condoms are preferred, but attention should be paid to the correct use; or oral contraceptive pills and other methods, irresponsible also do not take contraceptive measures of scum or let him bypass ~ women can remember to self-protection,)<br>
Prevention of sexually transmitted diseases: to eliminate promiscuity is the most effective measure to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, one of the husband and wife suffers from sexually transmitted diseases, should be husband and wife together for treatment, recommended the use of condoms during the period of illness, to prevent infections between husband and wife.<br>
with their own love for the first time should belong to a relatively happy thing, do not be to please the partner, experience freshness to do, so the mind must be good, they can be in the textbook or formal medical website to learn about the relevant knowledge, it is best to two people can communicate and discuss, in the most difficult to talk about our views on the things we contain the most profound understanding of the world and life. The process of any uncomfortable situation should be timely raised!<br>
Sex education is related to a person's life, different ages and different life situations should receive relevant education, the focus of childhood is to guide the child's correct attitude to help the child to develop a correct gender self-identification and awareness of gender roles, and for adolescent girls, the significance of this kind of education is particularly significant. For adolescent girls, this kind of education is particularly significant, for example, to correctly recognize normal physiological phenomena such as physiological period; in adulthood, this kind of education is mainly to help both spouses to establish a happy and harmonious conjugal life.</p>
